Object of Model is simulation is to approximate this expaction by using law of large numbers, 
which tells us that if Yj are a sequence of identically distributed independent random variables,
then with probability 1 the sequence converges to E(Y1).So the algorithm to price a call option by Monte Carlo is clear.
we draw random variables, x, from an N(0,1) distributed and compute.
